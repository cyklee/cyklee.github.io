<p>Hi, I'm Kevin C. Lee. In academic publications, you may find me as C-Y K Lee, K C-Y Lee, C K Lee (in earlier publications) or K. C. Lee (preferred). The confusion in all the name change was all a futile bid for search engine optimisation. Lee is ridiculously common and hyphenated names (C-Y) don't play well with many databases. Furthermore, the change in the K C ordering was to avoid having the identical initials as a fellow biologist from the University of Waikato.</p>
