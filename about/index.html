  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Hi, I'm Kevin C. Lee. In earlier academic publications, you will probably find me as C.-Y. K. Lee, K. C.-Y. Lee, C. K. Lee. These days, I prefer <b>K. C. Lee</b>. The confusion with all the names was caused by a futile bid for search engine optimisation. "Lee" is ridiculously common surname, and hyphenated initials (C-Y) don't play well with many databases. Furthermore, the change in the "K" "C" ordering was to avoid having the identical initials as a fellow biologist from the University of Waikato.</p>

  <p>Not to be confused with that brain surgeon in Michigan</p>
