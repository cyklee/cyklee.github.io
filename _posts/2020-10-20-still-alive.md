# Update

Hi, to you reading this post. It's embarrassing how much lack of update I've been putting into my personal/professional page. So update it is! Perhaps I should not be surprised how many things happened and how busy my life has gotten. Committments such as teaching, meetings, and the homefront have resulted in lifestyle/workstyle change from PhD days that I am still adapting to. It is also a lesson I should learn from regarding planning and making promises.

# This is a triumph

* Many exciting life events despite COVID19 lockdown
* Aersol project - literal trip around the world in 2019 - big dataset to work on!
* Survived making new courses and the mad scramble in adapting them to lockdown life.

# Reflection

* I've gotten better with R out of sheer usage (trying to squeeze in time for learning python)
* Metagenomics is hard

Once again, hopefully the next update will be more frequent (fingers crossed emoji).
