Update:

1. I'm going to the [STAMPS course](https://stamps.mbl.edu/index.php/Main_Page), so I've brushing up the github page. At least I've got rid of all the placeholder texts. I now have an "About" page.
2. I've made an effort to organise research data. It's a tricky issue because aside from personal usage, the data also belongs to others. While the data may not be important for their research for now, they may expect to find the data well documented and archived in years time. This is beyond software systems and into the realm of organisaiton systems. This is a point of headache/learning-opportunities Some efforts (read: meetings) have been made to integrate into the infrastructure and resoures available to the university.
3. I didn't end up using Evernotes. I think I will stick with Dropbox/Markdown unless I have completely unstructured text that needs to go somewhere.
4. My grand plan is to upload some learning notes I will be acquiring at STAMPS.
