# More life blog

Well, the promised update has taken much longer than expected. This blog is best updated when I'm in airport waiting lounge, it seems.

## What happened this year?

1. Went to Kanazawa two more times, March and October. This has helped establishing and solidifying collaborative relationship regarding biological aerosol studies.
2. I started working on a geothermal metagenome project. A project I can call my own, which is quite exciting. I have many draft notes I should and plan to consolidate.
3. With the installation of a new workstation computer, it's about time for me to update my methods notes and so it seems the outdated notes may no longer be necessary. I hope I can gather the new methods, potentially for future classes.

## TO DO (forever delayed but still on my mind)

1. Metagenomic notes
2. 16S/ITS amplicon analysis notes
3. Phylomatic (large-scale cyanobacterial phylogenomics script)
4. Updated 16S/ITS processing method - explore new tools to develop new pipelines, including more robust framework such as snakemake
5. Develop arduino based sensor system (affordable portable weather station for aerosol studies).

I will keep these update short and sweet, with the hope that I can do more regular updates.
