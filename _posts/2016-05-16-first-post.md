I've been playing around with github and static site generators (namely Pelican) for a while now. I think it's time for me to try and organise my writing/research material into locaitons that can be better maintained. At the moment, I have three groups of data:

1. Raw data (Local stoage and Dropbox)
2. Rough working notes (Local stoage with raw data, obscure pelican-powered site)
3. Cleaned-up notes, tutorials (pelican-powered site)

I am hoping to turn this github person site into a public facing portal and possibly host some of my projects. Meanwhile, I think I will try and polish up my current scheme.

1. my local storage scheme --> main PC, laptop, home PC
2. Dropbox clean up - done.
3. Rough working notes --> go to Evernotes
4. Publication quality notes (markdown, r markdown) --> to website or individual reports stored in Dropbox
